        <h1>Sound Matching through Wavetable Synthesizer</h1>

        <p>Automatic synthesizer programming is a technology that re-implements synthesized or 
          recorded sounds through synthesizers.</p>
        <p>Until now, research has only been conducted on re-implementation through parameter 
          manipulation in subtractive and fm synthesizers, but I have newly studied parameter 
          manipulation in wavetable synthesizers.</p>
        <p>In addition to the basic subtractive synthesizers amp envelope and filter operation 
          parameters, the wavetable synthesizer can customize waveforms in addition to sine, 
          square, and sawtooth waves, and is a widely used sound production tool because it can 
          create a very wide range of sounds.</p>
        <p>In this study, I created a model to predict the custom waveform shape from the amplitude 
          of the harmonics constituting the waveform in addition to the parameter prediction of 
          the subtractive synthesizer.</p>

        <img src="figure.png">

        <p>Since this model predicts the size of each of the 64 harmonics that are multiples of 
          the basic frequency, it uses a spectrogram in which the frequency is displayed linearly, 
          and sets the magnitudes of each predicted harmonic as the amplitude of the phase 0 sine 
          wave of the corresponding frequency and additive synthesizes them to create a waveform.</p>
        <p>Sounds made of 14 synthesizer parameters and 64 randomly designated harmonics between 0 
          and 1 was used as training data, so that correct predictions can be made even in special 
          cases, such as sounds with a size of 0.5.</p>
